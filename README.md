### [Project: Cinder](https://juancho-fe.github.io/ProjectCinder/)

Project: Cinder is an ambitious project with the goal of creating a fire emblem style engine (turn-based strategy). My plans so far includes:
  -making it browser-based using javascript 
  -making the maps, characters, and events easily customizable and shareable
  -co-op/pvp functionality
  -of course, completely free

The challenge: finishing it in 100 days.
